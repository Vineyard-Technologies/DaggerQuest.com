const e='---\r\ndescription: "Significant performance optimizations, stat system overhaul, combat rebalancing, and enhanced visual effects."\r\nversion: "0.3.7"\r\ntype: "patch-notes"\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\n- Various performance improvements have been implemented.\r\n- Reduced the file size of **DaggerQuest** by about half.\r\n- The **Hitstun Threshold** stat has been renamed to **Flinch Resistance**.\r\n- The **Block Chance** stat has been renamed to **Armor**.\r\n- Base **Armor** has been reduced from 5 to zero.\r\n- **Armor**, **Flinch Resistance**, and all the damage resistances use a formula with diminishing returns. The more of the stat you have, the less effective it is.\r\n- Having a shield equipped is no longer a requirement to successfully block.\r\n- **Kick** no longer can hit multiple enemies.\r\n- Reduced how much item mods scale with level.\r\n- Modified the formula that determines numerical values in item mods.\r\n- Reduced the attack speed of the **Goblin Warlock**.\r\n- Player abilities no longer scale with level, and have had their values retuned.\r\n- Leveling up closes the ability selector.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Sound effects with multiple variants would play some variants much less frequently than others.\r\n- **Kick** inflicted damage twice.\r\n- **Flinch Resistance** (formally known as **Hitstun Threshold**) displayed incorrect values in the Character menu.\r\n- The **Goblin Underling** could damage the player multiple times with his attack, in rare scenarios.\r\n- Player and enemy abilities would sometimes still do damage if the player or enemy died in the middle of using them.\r\n- Multiple door sound effects couldn\'t play at the same time, if multiple doors had been moused over.\r\n- Mods with very few possible numerical values didn\'t have a reduced chance at rolling a higher value.\r\n- **Leggings** didn\'t cast a shadow when equipped.\r\n- The player didn\'t obtain access to the correct abilities upon leveling up.';export{e as default};
